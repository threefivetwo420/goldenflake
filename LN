on the basis that it is unconsinable in that the lease cannot be forfieted/broken in any event other than active duty deployment [medical, employment loss, etc, it is nonnegotiable]. unfair geared only for the landlord. more over stipulations to cover costs for attorneys if a dispute is to arise, more over a threat to file a moption thing. is not fair or supported in the urlta/ landlord tennant law act. landlord accepts no liability nor responsibility for safety of the common place. the rights to terminate the contract due to safety/nuciance concerns in the unit are forcefully waived. the contract itself is nonnegiotable. rather even when complying with management to restore an  inactive lease by way of sublease on a verbally agreed date with said individual. management chose to involve police ensuing civil lawsuits and removal of said individual, rather than allowing for a partial payment of rent to continue the active lease and pay all debts in the contract refered to as rent. meanwhile threatening to sell unpaid rent debt to a collection agency if full payment is not made, despite partial payments being permissable as stated in contract. once again the pointless vague criterion and application process for subleasee determination demonstrates little fairness for the renter and guarantor since the unit may not be subleased.
