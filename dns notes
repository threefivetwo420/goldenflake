notes on rfc 1034 and 1035

1034 - 1987 [domain names and facilities]

SRI international began as stanford research institute until 1970

National Information Center (NIC) assigned Top Level Domains (TLP) ".com" , ".gov" , ".org" to
network hosts which were managed by SRI from 1970 to 1991, SRI is the first organization to assign TLP.

NIC was the information hub for the arpanet SRI the original node. Later to become the Defense Data Network (DDS)
Which was used by Universities and Government and other researchers. Apranet later became the internet.

Host names are/were important for routing traffic. since 1971 NIC role was to administer host tables for the network, later to go on to
administer IP

Random info about HNAME Query would return 
IP, Host Name, Computer, Software Language, IP/Protocol

Telnet is a protocol which allows you to connect hosts/computers over a TCP/IP network , the internet,

CRLF - Carriage Return & Linefeed 

So LF moves the paper up like a type writer, CR returns the cursor to the left most position. 

****
C++ example 

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout<<"Hello World\n\n";
    cout<<"************"; //this got overwritten
    cout<<"this is rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr";
    cout<<"\r here it is?";
    cout<<"================";
    //cout<<"this is \n";
    cout<<"--------------";
    cout<<"here is both       \r\nbubble";
    
    
    return 0;
}

****


So /r which is new age c++ CR will move cursor left and rewrite over the console.
