                        #writeInData would need to write the data into the array which was made with a random amount of index, write in data would only have 6 if clauses because the 6 data types would be run a random amount of times which would write all 6 data types possible to every index in the array. the control for the loop is stopping at random number - 1 and is starting at 0 so 0 is being checked against random number - 1 while counter 0 <= rn -1 then the loop will continue checking each randomly generated data type 1-6 or 0-5 should it be rand(5) + 1 since this is 1-6 no zero to avoid an empty array, like wise the rand(19) + 1 should be added as well to remove the 0 from the array possibilities. So what goes into the function is random number - 1, counter=0, data type random number. at the end of the while loop since it runs until counter is greater than random number - 1 meanwhile indexing the array, which won't quite set a new value for the incoming random data type. so the other variable should be handled outside of the loop where, when the while loop starts it should test the incoming data but also set off a new random number.  

    #so if countrFake != countr && integer == dataRan 
    	#run the new dataRan function
    #this should be run on one line
    
    #so if 0 == countr Do dataRan function




        Conditional Assignment Operator
                ||=
                which will assign a value only if a value has not already been assigned to a variable
                


           Assignment Operators
                && for both condition to be true
                || for one or the other other to be true

The simplest tube used is the triode, so called because it has three characteristic
elements: the cathode (surface which gives off electrons), the
plate (surface which receives electrons), and the grid (which controls the
current passing through the tube). In addition, there is a heater to bring
the cathode to the temperature required for it to emit electrons. Other tubes
used in the ENIAC are multi-grid tubes, for example, the pentode which
has 3 grids.
